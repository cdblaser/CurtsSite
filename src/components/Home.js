      go with web development - HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as backend (SQL,
      JSON, expressJS). I have two simple projects so far - 1. an idle game that
      utilizes state and lifecycles to increment a number, and 2. an interface
      to select gear and view bonuses based on said gear. And yes, I copied
      Shades of Purple theme from VSCode.

export default Home;
