        Welcome to my portfolio! Currently, I am learning React and everything
        to do with web development - HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as backend (SQL,
        and expressJS).

        I started this site as a coding project in Feb 2022. I started to sit
        down and seriously code in Oct 2021. I'm having a lot of fun working on
        these small projects. There is so much to learn, but practicing even
        just once a week is really helping me flesh out my knowledge.

        My hobbies include piano, riding my bicycle, and spending time with my
        family. I have two daughters, Zelda and Oriana - they are a handful but
        totes worth.
