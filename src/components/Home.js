        Welcome to my portfolio! Currently, I am learning React and everything
        to do with web development - HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as backend (SQL,
        JSON, expressJS).

        I have two simple projects so far - 1. an idle game that utilizes state
        and lifecycles to increment a number, and 2. an interface to select gear
        and view bonuses based on said gear (using state, but I think the code
        is written efficiently using a current/next node setup). Yes, I copied
        Shades of Purple theme from VSCode.

        Topics I have trouble with because I'm a boomer - 1. writing efficient
        code (stuff like writing forEach instead of map, using too many
        variables, etc.), and 2. keeping track of loops and whatnot in my head.
        I'm hoping that I get better, simply because it would make me a lot
        faster at coding. I am definitely quicker now than when I started about
        4 months ago (Oct 2021).

        Before attempting to become a programmer - In my first previous life, I
        was a pianist. I competed, against my will, but ended up winning some
        big competitions. Music is very personal to me nowadays, but I will play
        songs for my SO and daughters. In my 2nd previous life, I was a
        chemistry student. However, my desire to learn chemistry kind of waned,
        as academia is a harsh and unforgiving place.
